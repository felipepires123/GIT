                Hello my name is Carlos Felipe Ramos Pires, I am a beginner programmer, and I created this webpage to present some pages that I have created over time, since I started programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                The language i use is JavaScript, i also know the basics of PHP, but not used on these pages, and using HTML and CSS to structure everything.
